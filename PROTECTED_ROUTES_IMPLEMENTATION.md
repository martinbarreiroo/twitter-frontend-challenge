# Protected Routes Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented protected routes for your Twitter frontend application. The implementation includes authentication guards that protect authenticated-only routes and redirect unauthenticated users to sign-in.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Protected Routes Component (`ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- Guards routes that require authentication
- Redirects unauthenticated users to `/sign-in`
- Shows loading spinner while checking authentication
- Uses authentication context for centralized auth state

### 2. Public Routes Component (`PublicRoute.tsx`)
- Guards authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up)
- Redirects authenticated users to home page
- Prevents authenticated users from accessing login/register pages

### 3. Authentication Context (`AuthContext.tsx`)
- Centralized authentication state management
- Provides user data, authentication status, and auth functions
- Handles automatic token validation and user data fetching
- Manages login, logout, and user data refresh

### 4. Updated Router Configuration
The following routes are now protected and require authentication:

#### Protected Routes (Require Authentication):
- **Route**: `/` - **Component**: `HomePage`
- **Route**: `/recommendations` - **Component**: `RecommendationPage` 
- **Route**: `/profile/:id` - **Component**: `ProfilePage`
- **Route**: `/post/:id` - **Component**: `PostPage`
- **Route**: `/compose/tweet` - **Component**: `TweetPage`
- **Route**: `/compose/comment/:id` - **Component**: `CommentPage`

#### Public Routes (Redirect if authenticated):
- **Route**: `/sign-up` - **Component**: `SignUpPage`
- **Route**: `/sign-in` - **Component**: `SignInPage`

### 5. Enhanced Authentication Integration
- Updated sign-in and sign-up pages to use authentication context
- Updated logout functionality to use centralized auth state
- Updated components to use shared user state from context
- Improved error handling in authentication flows

## Key Features

### Automatic Redirects
- Unauthenticated users accessing protected routes → redirected to `/sign-in`
- Authenticated users accessing auth pages → redirected to `/`
- Invalid/expired tokens → automatically removed and user redirected to sign-in

### Loading States
- Shows loading spinner while authentication status is being verified
- Prevents flash of wrong content during initial load

### Token Management
- Automatic token validation on app load
- Invalid tokens are automatically removed
- Token is stored in localStorage for persistence

### Centralized Auth State
- Single source of truth for authentication status
- Shared user data across all components
- Simplified authentication logic throughout the app

## How It Works

1. **App Initialization**: When the app loads, the `AuthProvider` checks for an existing token in localStorage
2. **Token Validation**: If a token exists, it's validated with the backend using the `isLogged` API call
3. **User Data Fetching**: If the token is valid, user data is fetched and stored in context
4. **Route Protection**: Each route is wrapped with either `ProtectedRoute` or `PublicRoute` guards
5. **Automatic Redirects**: Based on authentication status, users are redirected to appropriate pages

## File Structure

│   ├── public-route/

└── pages/auth/
    ├── sign-in/SignInPage.tsx      # Updated to use auth context
    └── sign-up/SignUpPage.tsx      # Updated to use auth context
```

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Without Authentication**:
   - Visit any protected route (e.g., `/`, `/recommendations`)
   - Should redirect to `/sign-in`

2. **With Authentication**:
   - Sign in successfully
   - Should be able to access all protected routes
   - Visit `/sign-in` or `/sign-up` → should redirect to `/`

3. **Invalid Token**:
   - Manually set an invalid token in localStorage
   - Refresh the page → should remove token and redirect to sign-in

4. **Logout**:
   - Use the logout functionality
   - Should clear token and redirect to sign-in
   - Accessing protected routes should now redirect to sign-in

## Benefits

- **Security**: All sensitive routes are properly protected
- **User Experience**: Seamless redirects and loading states
- **Maintainability**: Centralized authentication logic
- **Performance**: Efficient token validation and user data management
- **Consistency**: Unified authentication behavior across the app

The implementation follows React best practices and provides a robust authentication system for your Twitter frontend application.
